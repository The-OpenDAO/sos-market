# SOSMarket

SOSMarket is an Autonomous Prediction Market Protocol built for cross-chain information exchange and trading, based on Polkadot.

## Project Overview

Our web interface is built with React.

The backend is being developed in partnership with [Bepro.network](https://github.com/bepronetwork), through [`bepro-js`](https://github.com/bepronetwork/bepro-js). You can have a look on our smart contract [here](https://github.com/bepronetwork/bepro-js/blob/feature/prediction-markets/contracts/PredictionMarket.sol).

We're currently running in closed Beta on the Kovan testnet. You can access it at [https://app.polkamarkets.com](https://app.polkamarkets.com)
