The categories are defined in multiple places, such as the sidebar, homepage and the market creation form. Here are the places where theyâ€™re defined: https://github.com/Polkamarkets/polkamarkets-web/search?q=politics

For the market creation form, itâ€™ll be this one: https://github.com/Polkamarkets/polkamarkets-web/blob/2ab4c9c3819207a3fb7b14e564455483c4153bdf/src/components/CreateMarketForm/CreateMarketFormConfigure.tsx
